## Introduction
Traditional voting systems often face challenges related to security, transparency, and trust. Blockchain technology offers a promising solution to these challenges by providing a decentralized and immutable ledger where votes can be securely recorded. This project demonstrates the application of blockchain in a voting system, allowing participants to cast their votes and verify the integrity of the overall process.

## Features
- **Decentralization**: The voting system operates on a decentralized network of nodes, ensuring that no single entity has control over the entire process.
- **Immutable Record**: Each vote is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable and tamper-proof history of all voting activities.
- **Transparency**: The voting process and results are transparent to all participants, providing increased trust and reducing the potential for fraud.
- **Anonymity**: Votes are anonymized, maintaining the privacy of individual voters.
- **Verifiability**: Each participant can verify their own vote and the overall integrity of the system through cryptographic proofs.
- **Security**: The use of blockchain technology enhances the security of the voting system by protecting against unauthorized access and tampering.
- **Auditability**: The complete history of votes can be audited, allowing for post-election analysis and investigations.

## Technology Stack
The voting system is built using the following technologies:
- **Blockchain**: The underlying blockchain infrastructure is implemented using a popular blockchain framework such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric.
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts are utilized to define the rules and logic of the voting process, ensuring automation and transparency.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly web interface is provided for participants to interact with the voting system, cast votes, and verify results.
- **Cryptographic Algorithms**: Various cryptographic algorithms such as hashing, digital signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs are employed to ensure security and privacy.

## Installation
