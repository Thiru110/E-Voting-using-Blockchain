## Introduction
Traditional voting systems often face challenges related to security, transparency, and trust. Blockchain technology offers a promising solution to these challenges by providing a decentralized and immutable ledger where votes can be securely recorded. This project demonstrates the application of blockchain in a voting system, allowing participants to cast their votes and verify the integrity of the overall process.

## Features
- **Decentralization**: The voting system operates on a decentralized network of nodes, ensuring that no single entity has control over the entire process.
- **Immutable Record**: Each vote is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable and tamper-proof history of all voting activities.
- **Transparency**: The voting process and results are transparent to all participants, providing increased trust and reducing the potential for fraud.
- **Anonymity**: Votes are anonymized, maintaining the privacy of individual voters.
- **Verifiability**: Each participant can verify their own vote and the overall integrity of the system through cryptographic proofs.
- **Security**: The use of blockchain technology enhances the security of the voting system by protecting against unauthorized access and tampering.
- **Auditability**: The complete history of votes can be audited, allowing for post-election analysis and investigations.

## Technology Stack
The voting system is built using the following technologies:
- **Blockchain**: The underlying blockchain infrastructure is implemented using a popular blockchain framework such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric.
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts are utilized to define the rules and logic of the voting process, ensuring automation and transparency.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly web interface is provided for participants to interact with the voting system, cast votes, and verify results.
- **Cryptographic Algorithms**: Various cryptographic algorithms such as hashing, digital signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs are employed to ensure security and privacy.

## Installation
To install and set up the voting system locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/mindsofraj/E-Voting-using-Blockchain.git
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
   ```shell
   cd client
   npm install
   ```shell
   cd server
   npm install
4. Install the [Ganache UI](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) and quickstart a workspace.
5. Next we need install Truffle to Compile and Deploy our Smart Contracts.
   ```shell
   npm install -g truffle
6. After installation of truffle connect the truffle-config.js file with the Ganache.
8. Start the blockchain network and deploy the smart contracts.
9. Launch the web application and access it via a web browser.
   In client side run,
   ```shell
   npm run dev
   In server side run,
   ```shell
   node index.js 
   
## Usage
1. Visit the web application through your preferred web browser.
2. Create an account or log in if you already have one.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to cast your vote.
4. After voting, admin will publish results and  you can verify the integrity of your vote and the overall results through cryptographic proofs and transparency features provided by the system.
5. Explore the audit functionality to analyze voting patterns and perform post-election investigations.
